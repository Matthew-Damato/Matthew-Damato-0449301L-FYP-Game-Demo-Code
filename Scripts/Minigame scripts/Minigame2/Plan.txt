Plan of second minigame to finish by the 16th:

- Player is represented by an icon and has a "term" or answer displayed on the bottom of the screen.
- the player must launch it into the correct definition or question
- the player earns a point for every correct answer they obtain.
- the player does not lose a point for incorrect guesses.
- the player is acting on a timer for each shot.

As such, this will function as a basic multiple choice exersize, with no need to roam about an enviroment. players 
instead are asked to act fast against a timer to earn points. A fixed number of questions are asked.


How to handle the questions:
    players need only click on the correct answer, and it will be selected. 
    Should they guess wrong, they lose a life.
    if time runs out, they lose a life.
    Earn points by guessing correctly.
    This has a higher point pay then the previous game on account of difficulty.

How am I going to decide on a correct answer? 
    Generate 5 random numbers. 
    I need ONLY 2 numbers to match. These are the correct answers. -> inefficient. Too many possiblilities, and it would not work.
    Instead:
        Create a 6th list containing correct answers to each question. 
        Have the player generated answer correspond to the 



Progress:
    Questions are being randomly generated correctly.
    Next, I need a functioning timer, which leaves each question generated for x sec. Done using refreash
    Next, a way to answer:
        Buttons!
    Done. Answers can now be selected. 
    
Final step: 
    Make the needed variables for the game manager script to read.
    Done!



Finished
