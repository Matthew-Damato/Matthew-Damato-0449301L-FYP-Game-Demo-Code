Requirements: 
    - Achievements (As per recommendation)
        A basic list of achievements. These will be included to incentivese the player to continue playing.
    - AI
        The ai proper must consider 3 elements:
        
        The first is the user's progress to the next module. This will check how well the user is doing in 
        the module, and based on this, decide if they should progress to the next.

        The second deals with the minigame selection. This records which minigames the user does best in 
        based on grade obtained. This information is then used to present further minigames. For example,
        if the user is detected to be continuously selecting 1 minigame and scoring top score, they are then required
        to complete a differant minigame to a similar score to proceed. 

        The final AI component would be in the social media aspect. This would include taking note of friend progress, 
        and allowing certain features and aid when needed. For the sake of this demo, friend accounts will be hardcoded
        in.
